# Calcium Imaging Analysis

User-friendly software for motion-correcting calcium imaging videos, automatically finding ROIs using the CNMF method and manually refining them. This software uses the [CaImAn](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn) package under the hood for motion correction, ROI finding, and refinement of ROIs. Optionally, the [suite2p](https://github.com/MouseLand/suite2p) package can also be used for ROI finding.

## Required Modules
This software requires Python 3 and the following modules:

- CaImAn (and all of its required modules â€“ see [the CaImAn repository](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn) for installation instructions)
